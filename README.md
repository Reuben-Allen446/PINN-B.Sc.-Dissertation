# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) B.Sc. Dissertation

This repository contains the final-year B.Sc. dissertation project by **Reuben Allen**, exploring the use of **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)** for solving physical and financial partial differential equations (PDEs).

**Title:** *Are Physics-Informed Neural Networks the Future of Financial Modelling?*

## Project Overview

This dissertation investigates how PINNs can solve classical PDEs such as the wave equation and extends this approach to financial domains. Applications include the Black–Scholes model, stochastic volatility, and hybrid data-driven techniques. The project integrates theoretical understanding with empirical validation.
